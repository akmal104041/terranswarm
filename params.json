It is a Terran StarCraft/BWAPI bot that uses a task allocation algorithm to decide its actions. The parameters of task allocation were adjusted with a Genetic Algorithm in matches against StarCraft's native AI.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nCurrently, there is one publication from this project:\r\n\r\n- Tavares AR, Azpurua H, Chaimowicz L. _Evolving swarm intelligence for task allocation in a real time strategy game_.
